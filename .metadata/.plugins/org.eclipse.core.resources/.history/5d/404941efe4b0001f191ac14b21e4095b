/*
 *  Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself only. 
 *  In other words, prime numbers can't be divided by other numbers than itself or 1. 
 *  For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17.... are the prime numbers.
 *  
 *  Note: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. 
 *  The 2 is the only even prime number because all the other even numbers can be divided by 2.
